**1249**: start writing the update journal, have been learning Linux, git, virtual environment, and zsh in the past week. 

**1720**: succesfully create cell object that contain integrin. My computer is so slow, need to be repaired as soon as possibe. 

**2208**: start working again. Had unninstaled every windows program that seems heavy. Also configure windows settings to focus on performance. Result: improvement in performance.

**2317**: Confused to find the best nearest neighbor algorithm.

**1449**: it's been almost 2 months i have not updating my code (especially the journal) let we start again. Today i found that i nearly forgot the code i'd written. So, I would like to learn about commenting and documentation in a proper way.

**1644**: finishing this code session, adding several comments to help recalling when I abandon the code
for a long time. 
TODO: making the code looks neater especially the long line codes.

**1413**: waiting for a couple of minutes to start opening the vscode because there is an update that need to be installed. We will continue to do the last assignment

**1738**: TODO: finish the code, especially the cell section. and we can continue the code building.

### 20220606
**1336**: start to do some progress today until 1630. I'll finish the task about making some comment and documentaries for the code. Bismillah.

**1709**: I have done finishing the code but after that i was distracted by an email from Osaka about the visa. _TODO_: try the PATCON in Jupyter notebook until the program can generate proper nanopattern.

### 20220607
**1335**: After bought a gallon of water and cleaning the water dispenser, finally i can start to continue the thesis work. Today i would like to try implement the program on jupyter notebook.

**1651**: found out that we can use 'list' as variabel name

**1716**: Finish coding today. Have done updating the algorithm for get value. Found out the built in function 'index' to find the index number of an element in a list. Found out that we avoid to use 'list' as variable name. And also found out the pythonic way to convert string number into float
_TODO_: There is an error regarding the library, the program seems not updated and refer to old program, the string of the ligand position list contain space and need to be separated. TLDR; error in get value function

### 20220608
**1339**: Bismillah, start to make some progress today. As we know that yesterday I got some homeworks, so today I'll try to finish the homework.

**1617**: Alhamdulillah, nanopattern has been succesfully created. I also added show function to draw the nanopattern only. I got a circles function that can directly print the ligand in nanopattern. Next, build the cells.

**1712**: Finish coding for today. Succesfully build the nanopattern, adding get_value function for reading cell properties, and also start to build the cells. TODO: build the cell and show the cells, one by one and all cells.
