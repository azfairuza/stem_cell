**1249**: start writing the update journal, have been learning Linux, git, virtual environment, and zsh in the past week. 

**1720**: succesfully create cell object that contain integrin. My computer is so slow, need to be repaired as soon as possibe. 

**2208**: start working again. Had unninstaled every windows program that seems heavy. Also configure windows settings to focus on performance. Result: improvement in performance.

**2317**: Confused to find the best nearest neighbor algorithm. 

### 20220527
**1449**: it's been almost 2 months i have not updating my code (especially the journal) let we start again. Today i found that i nearly forgot the code i'd written. So, I would like to learn about commenting and documentation in a proper way.

**1644**: finishing this code session, adding several comments to help recalling when I abandon the code
for a long time. 
TODO: making the code looks neater especially the long line codes.

### 20220531
**1413**: waiting for a couple of minutes to start opening the vscode because there is an update that need to be installed. We will continue to do the last assignment

**1738**: TODO: finish the code, especially the cell section. and we can continue the code building.

### 20220606
**1336**: start to do some progress today until 1630. I'll finish the task about making some comment and documentaries for the code. Bismillah.

**1709**: I have done finishing the code but after that i was distracted by an email from Osaka about the visa. _TODO_: try the PATCON in Jupyter notebook until the program can generate proper nanopattern.

### 20220607
**1335**: After bought a gallon of water and cleaning the water dispenser, finally i can start to continue the thesis work. Today i would like to try implement the program on jupyter notebook.

**1651**: found out that we can use 'list' as variabel name

**1716**: Finish coding today. Have done updating the algorithm for get value. Found out the built in function 'index' to find the index number of an element in a list. Found out that we avoid to use 'list' as variable name. And also found out the pythonic way to convert string number into float
_TODO_: There is an error regarding the library, the program seems not updated and refer to old program, the string of the ligand position list contain space and need to be separated. TLDR; error in get value function

### 20220608
**1339**: Bismillah, start to make some progress today. As we know that yesterday I got some homeworks, so today I'll try to finish the homework.

**1617**: Alhamdulillah, nanopattern has been succesfully created. I also added show function to draw the nanopattern only. I got a circles function that can directly print the ligand in nanopattern. Next, build the cells.

**1712**: Finish coding for today. Succesfully build the nanopattern, adding get_value function for reading cell properties, and also start to build the cells. TODO: build the cell and show the cells, one by one and all cells. 

### 20220609
**0933**: bismillah, today I start coding quite early. At this time, the lab has agenda to discuss another project so it is quite crowded. But i love it. For the task that i want to finish today, as I have wrote yesterday, I want to make show function for cell to display cell that has been built. The show function has 2 option, it can show a single cell or all cell at once.

**1655**: succesfully generate cell and draw for single cell
_TODO_: 1. draw for multi cell or many cell at once
        2. making flag so that if the integrin is to much the cell cannot be generated

### 20220616
**0827**: Bismillah, starting early on. I need to finish the tasks at 23 june 2022. Hopefully i could make it in time. Right now i want to finish the class attribute to be submited to supervisor. 

**0946**: finish creating flowchart for class attribute and method

**1042**: After taking break, start to build the code again. Try to finish the TODO list in the last homework.

**1130**: succesfully adding flag and limit so that the integrin in the cell will not be too much

**1511**: succesfully implement the showAll() function so that the object can show all the cells and nanopattern (with an option for showing it or not)

### 20220617
**0940**: Bismillah, little bit late to start. Today i would like to finish the flowchart for simulation. After the flowchart has finished, i would show it to supervisors and create the code in the weekend. Ganbare!

**1124**: Take a break. Jumatan. Have done adding subdiagram in the simulation flowchart. 

**1700**: forget to timestamp the previous starting time of working, but i have finisihed the simulation flowchart and now waiting for the respond from supervisor. I also learned about unpacking operator `*` and unpacking dictionary operator `**` in python. I plan to use `*args` and `**kwargs` in my simulation function. 
_TODO_: 1. build an option to save the diagram in every `show()` and `showAll()` function
        2. build the simulation based on the flowchart that has been made in [simulation flow file](https://github.com/azfairuza/stem_cell/blob/master/simulationflow.md)

### 20220621
**1411**: Bismillah. After weekend break, today i start the work quite late because my motorbike got some trouble in the accu batery. Besides, my flowchart has been approved by supervisor, so this day i want to implement it into the code. Also i have some todo-list that need to be done. 

### 20220622
**0658**: Bismillah. As the lore said, indonesian people has quite good skill at building a thousand temple in just one night. So do I, insyaaAllah. haha. But, what it takes? I need to focus and do the work at maximum pace. Yesterday, i was forgotten to write the evening journal. I have done the `show()` function in nanopattern. Next, i want to upgrade the `show()` function in cell and `showAll()` function in general procedures. After that i can start building the simulation. 

**1801**: finish working on the lab. I have been building the simulation procedure based on the flowchart that had been made. Currently, the simulation procedure is nearly finished as the update procedure and move procedure are not yet created. Hopefully this night, I can run the system and fix some bugs. 

### 202220623
**0713**: Bismillah. Times always moving, never stop nor slowing down. Today, i hope that i can run the program. If the program run smoothly, next thing to do is to generate the center of mass data for every cell. 

**1824**: Alhamdulillah, the program has been running. There are several bugs that i found and i have fixed it during the afternoon session. The simulate version 1 is 90% complete. Next, i need to write the report to my supervisor and also adding procedure to calculate the center of mass of the cell. After i got the data, i can plot it and look the distance. The hipothesis is the center of mass will be getting closer if there is integrin-integrin interaction.

###20220624
**0737**: Bismillah. Today i would like to take some data and making report to mya supervisor until before jummu'ah prayer. After that i would like to make second simulate flowchart that include competition between the ligand. Then if i still got time, i would like to reupdate the code into consistency especially building setter and getter. That is today goals.
